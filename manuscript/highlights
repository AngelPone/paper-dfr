- Presents forecast reconciliation framework for discrete hierarchical time series.
- Proposed DFR algorithm optimises the penalised Brier Score.
- Optimisation cast as assignment solved using Quadratic Programming.
- Second algorithm handles computational complexity of larger hierarchies.
- Simulations and applications show the effectiveness of our framework.
