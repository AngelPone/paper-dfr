- We present a discrete reconciliation framework for count hierarchical time series.
- The proposed DFR algorithm uses quadratic programming to optimise penalised Brier Score.
- The SDFR algorithm is introduced to handle large hierarchies.
- Simulations and applications show the superiority of our framework.
