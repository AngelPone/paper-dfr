\noindent Dear Editor,
\vspace{1cm}

Please find the revised manuscript entitled ``Discrete Forecast Reconciliation'' by Bohan Zhang, Anastasios Panagiotelis and Yanfei Kang, which
we wish to resubmit for publication as a regular article in \emph{European Journal of Operational Research}.  We are very grateful to the Editor, Associate Editor, and the three anonymous referees for their detailed and constructive comments that significantly improve the quality of this paper. In this revision, we have addressed all the comments, providing a point-to-point response to each comment made by the review team. We hope you find this version satisfactory, and we are happy to hear from your any
further feedback.

In this paper, we develop a formal discrete forecast reconciliation framework that optimises scoring rules using quadratic programming. The proposed framework produces coherent joint probabilistic forecasts for count hierarchical time series. Two discrete reconciliation algorithms are proposed and compared to generalisations of the top-down and bottom-up approaches to count data. Two simulation experiments and two empirical examples are conducted to validate that the proposed reconciliation algorithms improve forecast accuracy. The empirical applications are to forecast  criminal offences in Washington D.C. and sales in Walmart M5 dataset. Compared to the top-down and bottom-up approaches, the proposed framework shows superior performance in both simulations and empirical studies. The code for reproducing the results is available at \url{https://github.com/AngelPone/paper-dfr}.

We hope that the manuscript meets the standards of your journal. Thank you for your consideration.
