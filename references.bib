  abstract = {The R package tscount provides likelihood-based estimation methods for analysis and modeling of count time series following generalized linear models. This is a flexible class of models which can describe serial correlation in a parsimonious way. The conditional mean of the process is linked to its past values, to past observations and to potential covariate effects. The package allows for models with the identity and with the logarithmic link function. The conditional distribution can be Poisson or negative binomial. An important special case of this class is the so-called INGARCH model and its log-linear extension. The package includes methods for model fitting and assessment, prediction and intervention analysis. This paper summarizes the theoretical background of these methods. It gives details on the implementation of the package and provides simulation results for models which have not been studied theoretically before. The usage of the package is illustrated by two data examples. Additionally, we provide a review of R packages which can be used for count time series analysis. This includes a detailed comparison of tscount to those packages.},

  abstract = {In this article we consider geometric ergodicity and likelihood-based inference for linear and nonlinear Poisson autoregression. In the linear case, the conditional mean is linked linearly to its past values, as well as to the observed values of the Poisson process. This also applies to the conditional variance, making possible interpretation as an integer-valued generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity process. In a nonlinear conditional Poisson model, the conditional mean is a nonlinear function of its past values and past observations. As a particular example, we consider an exponential autoregressive Poisson model for time series. Under geometric ergodicity, the maximum likelihood estimators are shown to be asymptotically Gaussian in the linear model. In addition, we provide a consistent estimator of their asymptotic covariance matrix. Our approach to verifying geometric ergodicity proceeds via Markov theory and irreducibility. Finding transparent conditions for proving ergodicity turns out to be a delicate problem in the original model formulation. This problem is circumvented by allowing a perturbation of the model. We show that as the perturbations can be chosen to be arbitrarily small, the differences between the perturbed and nonperturbed versions vanish as far as the asymptotic distribution of the parameter estimates is concerned. This article has supplementary material online.},

  abstract = {Intermittent demand forecasting has been widely researched in the context of spare parts management. However, it is becoming increasingly relevant to many other areas, such as retailing, where at the very disaggregate level time series may be highly intermittent, but at more aggregate levels are likely to exhibit trends and seasonal patterns. The vast majority of intermittent demand forecasting methods are inappropriate for producing forecasts with such features. We propose using temporal hierarchies to produce forecasts that demonstrate these traits at the various aggregation levels, effectively informing the resulting intermittent forecasts of these patterns that are identifiable only at higher levels. We conduct an empirical evaluation on real data and demonstrate statistically significant gains for both point and quantile forecasts.},

  abstract = {The explosion of time series data in recent years has brought a flourish of new time series analysis methods, for forecasting, clustering, classification and other tasks. The evaluation of these new methods requires either collecting or simulating a diverse set of time series benchmarking data to enable reliable comparisons against alternative approaches. We propose GeneRAting TIme Series with diverse and controllable characteristics, named GRATIS, with the use of mixture autoregressive (MAR) models. We simulate sets of time series using MAR models and investigate the diversity and coverage of the generated time series in a time series feature space. By tuning the parameters of the MAR models, GRATIS is also able to efficiently generate new time series with controllable features. In general, as a costless surrogate to the traditional data collection approach, GRATIS can be used as an evaluation tool for tasks such as time series forecasting and classification. We illustrate the usefulness of our time series generation process through a time series forecasting application.},

One of the commentaries noted that the results had not been tested for statistical significance. This paper undertakes such an analysis by examining the primary findings of that competition. We introduce a new methodology that has not previously been used to evaluate economic forecasts: multiple comparisons. We use this technique to compare each method against the best and against the mean. We conclude that the accuracy of the various methods does differ significantly, and that some methods are significantly better than others. We confirm that there is no relationship between complexity and accuracy but also show that there is a significant relationship among the various measures of accuracy. Finally, we find that the M3 conclusion that a combination of methods is better than that of the methods being combined was not proven.},
